finding:
comparision between human and mouse: percentage: 89.64%, alignment score: 1091
comparision between human and random sequence: percentage: 5.41%, alignment score: -250
comparision between mouse and random sequence : percentage: 5.86%, alignment score: -250

interperation:
about human sequence and mouse sequence: the higher alignment score and percentage are, the more similar two sequence are.
from the data we can see that the aligment score is very high (about 1000),indicating that there are many similar amino acid.
The high level percentage verifys that these two sequence are very similar.
Meanwhile, the data of comparision between human and random sequence and between mouse and random sequence are very similar,
these comfirm that human and mouse sequence are similar as well.

the high similarity may predict that human and mouse may have the same ancestor. Though human and mouse look quite different,
they still have many similarity. For example, both of them are mammals. therefore, the existence of a homologous ancestor is
reasonable. To make a further study to check the hypothesis, more sequence sample should be compared.
