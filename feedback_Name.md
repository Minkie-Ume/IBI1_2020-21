in this file I will explain what modification I have made in practical4-6 
according to the feedback I recieved.

week4:
no modification is made for there's no mistake in the practical.

week5:
variables.py:
For variable.py, I didn't write how I compare the values of d and e. So I 
write three ways to compare d and e, then I get the result that d is bigger 
then e.

fibonacci.py
For fibonacci.py, I only printed the 12th value. As the modification I use
 for loop command to print the first 13 value.

r_rate.py
For r_rate.py, I didn't write pseudocode, so I rewrite the pseudocode.
