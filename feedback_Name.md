in this file I will explain what modification I have made in practical4-6 
according to the feedback I recieved.

week4:
no modification is made for there's no mistake in the practical.

week5:
variables.py:
For variable.py, I didn't write how I compare the values of d and e. So I 
write three ways to compare d and e, then I get the result that d is bigger 
then e.

fibonacci.py:
For fibonacci.py, I only printed the 12th value. As the modification I use
 for loop command to print the first 13 value.

r_rate.py:
For r_rate.py, I didn't write pseudocode, so I rewrite the pseudocode.

week6
pie.py:
For pie.py which was used to make a pie chart, I didn't display a frequency
table to make a pie chart. Therefore, I set a dictionary of total case in
countries and compute the frequency of each country to develop a frequency 
table. Then, I make a pie chart according to the frequency table.

gene.py:
Gene.py is a file which was used to calculate the average exon length and 
make a boxplot. I didn't calculate the average length for each gene and use
total exon length to make a boxplot. So I complete my code to compute the 
average length and use the average length to make a boxplot.
